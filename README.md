# My Statistical Project

A statistical analysis project.

## Git

The project is going to be stored in . Do the following to initialize the repo:

```plain
git init
git checkout -b develop
git add .
git commit -m first commit
git push --set-upstream origin develop
```

## Project Structure

├── logs/                 # Logs of the package
├── environment.yml       # Conda environment
├── plot_style.mlpstyle   # Personal style for the plots
├── ruff.toml             # Ruff configurations
└── pyproject.toml        # Python project configuration
```

All folders starting with a dot (e.g. `.github`) are configurations folders and should not be considered.
 The important folder is `report` since it contains the final report and `report/figures` since it contains all the figures produced in high quality.

## Setup

This project uses conda for environment management.

```bash
# Environment should be created automatically during project generation
# If not, create it manually:
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate my_statistical_project
```

## Usage

1. **Data Storage**:
   - Place raw data in `data/raw/`
   - Store external data in `data/external/`
   - Save processed datasets in `data/processed/`

2. **Analysis**:
   - Create Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploration and analysis
   - Write reusable functions in the `my_statistical_project/` package

3. **Reporting**:
   - Generate figures and tables from your analysis
   - Save figures to `report/figures/`
   - Save tables to `report/tables/`
   - Edit `report/report.tex` to document your findings
   - Compile the LaTeX report using your preferred LaTeX editor or command line:

     ```bash
     cd report
     pdflatex report.tex
     ```

## Statistical Tools

This project is set up with:

- PyMC and ArviZ for Bayesian modeling
- NumPy, SciPy, pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- statsmodels for statistical models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
